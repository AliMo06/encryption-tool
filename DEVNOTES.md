HOW TO RUN THE CODE:
    You can currently compile the code by running the following command:

    g++ main.cpp aes.cpp caesar.cpp rsa.cpp -o main

    Then run the exe it generates from that by using the ".\main.exe" command.

PROGRESS/TODO:
    Currently only some code skeletons are made for some running, but nothing is really implemented.
    Lets start by implementing a caesar cipher and go from there.
    Other Algorithims to we will implment will be:
    AES
    RSA
    Maybe a Hash-Based One?
